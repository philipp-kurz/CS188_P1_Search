# CS188_P1_Search
Implemented graph search algorithms (`DFS`, `BFS`, `UCS`/`Dijkstra's`, `A*`) and heuristics (`Euclidian` and `Manhattan heuristic`) to help Pacman find paths through his maze world. [Project 1 for CS188](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/project1) - "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020.

The code is based on skeleton code from the class. Project was completed using the PyCharm Python IDE. This submission received full score.
